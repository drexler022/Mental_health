Hi, I've been feeling really overwhelmed and down lately. Ever since I started my new job, everything just feels off. I used to enjoy things like reading and playing the piano, but now I just can't find the energy or interest. I see. Starting a new job can be a significant change and can bring about various emotions. Can you tell me more about your experience at the new company? Sure. I was excited at first, thinking it would be a fresh start. But the work culture is so different from my previous job. The expectations are high, and I often feel left out during team meetings or social events. Everyone seems to know each other so well, and I feel like an outsider. It sounds like you're facing challenges both professionally and socially, which can certainly be tough. Remember, any change, especially one as significant as a new job, can take time to adjust to. Have you tried discussing your feelings with any of your colleagues or superiors? A little. I spoke to my immediate supervisor about the workload, and he just said it would get better over time. But I'm drowning in tasks, and the isolation just amplifies everything. Some days, I wonder if I made the right decision switching jobs. It's natural to question decisions, especially when facing challenges. Feeling isolated and overwhelmed can significantly impact your well-being. What do you typically do during breaks or after work? I usually stay at my desk during breaks, trying to catch up on work. After work, I'm so mentally drained that I just go home and sleep. The weekends aren't any better. I try to prepare for the upcoming week, and I've been avoiding my friends because I don't want to burden them with my problems. It sounds like you've been isolating yourself, which can make feelings of loneliness and stress more pronounced. Let's work on strategies to help you integrate better at work and find balance. Have you considered joining any workgroups or attending company social events? I attended a couple of events, but I felt so out of place. Everyone was talking about past experiences and inside jokes. I just stood there, feeling awkward. It's understandable to feel that way in a new environment. But remember, everyone at that company was once new too. It might help to find a mentor or a colleague who can guide you and introduce you to others. Have there been any positives or aspects of the job you enjoy? Well, the actual work I do is interesting, and I believe in the company's mission. There's also one colleague, Lisa, who's been kind to me. We had lunch once, and she shared her initial struggles when she joined. That's a good start. Perhaps you can build on that relationship with Lisa. She might offer insights and introduce you to others, making the environment more welcoming. It's essential to have allies in any workplace. How are you coping with the workload? It's been tough. I often work late, trying to meet deadlines. I'm not getting enough sleep, and that just adds to my stress. It's crucial to set boundaries for your well-being. Not getting adequate rest can exacerbate feelings of anxiety and depression. Let's explore ways to manage your time better and communicate your needs at work. Remember, it's okay to ask for help or clarification. I fear that asking too many questions might make me look incompetent. I don't want to lose this job. Everyone needs guidance, especially when adapting to a new environment. It's better to ask and get clarity than to struggle in silence. Over time, with understanding and support, you'll likely find your footing. For now, let's focus on strategies to help you manage stress and feel more connected, both at work and outside. Thank you. It's comforting to talk about this. I've felt so alone in this struggle. You're not alone. Many people face challenges when transitioning to a new job. With time, effort, and support, you can navigate these challenges and find a sense of belonging and purpose in your new role. We'll work on this journey together. I appreciate your support. I just can't shake the feeling that everyone's judging me. At my last job, I was confident, I knew my role inside out. Here, everything is so new, and I'm always second-guessing myself. It's completely normal to feel this way, especially when transitioning from a place where you felt competent and secure to an unfamiliar environment. Comparing your current experience with your previous one is natural. But it's essential to remember that you were once new at your last job too. How did you handle challenges when you first started there? I guess you're right. When I first started at my previous job, I had similar anxieties. Over time, I made friends, understood the workflow, and built my confidence. But this time, it feels more intense, probably because I had such high expectations for this new position. Expectations can certainly influence our experiences. When reality doesn't align with our expectations, it can lead to feelings of disappointment or anxiety. It's helpful to set realistic expectations and give yourself grace as you navigate this new chapter. Regarding the social aspect, what's one step you think you could take to foster connections at work? Maybe I could invite Lisa for a coffee after work. We've had a few good conversations, and she's been with the company for a while. She might have some advice or even introduce me to a few more people. That's an excellent idea. Building relationships one at a time can make the process seem less daunting. Over time, these connections can multiply. Regarding your workload, have you considered setting specific work hours and taking short breaks to rejuvenate? I've tried, but the workload just seems endless. Every time I complete one task, two more pop up. The idea of taking breaks sounds nice, but I fear I'll fall further behind. I understand your concerns. But consider this: working continuously without breaks can decrease your productivity and increase mistakes due to fatigue. Taking short, scheduled breaks can refresh your mind and increase efficiency. Additionally, consider discussing with your supervisor about prioritizing tasks. They might offer guidance on what needs immediate attention and what can wait. I've not looked at it that way. Maybe I should give it a try. I just fear appearing as if I'm not dedicated enough. Dedication isn't just about the number of hours you put in. It's about the quality of your work, your commitment to the team, and your ability to maintain a sustainable work pace. Burning out won't benefit you or your company. Setting boundaries and understanding your limits is a sign of self-awareness and maturity. You're right. I need to find a balance and maybe be a bit patient with myself. It's just been hard admitting that I'm struggling. Admitting you're facing challenges is a strength, not a weakness. It's the first step toward finding solutions. Remember, you're not alone in this. We'll work together to develop strategies that will help you adjust to your new role and find the joy and satisfaction you're seeking. Thank you. Talking about it has already made me feel better. I'm glad we had this session. I'm glad too. Remember, transitions can be tough, but they're also opportunities for growth. We'll navigate this together."}],"items":[{"start_time":"0.009","end_time":"0.36","alternatives":[{"confidence":"0.999","content":"Machine"}],"type":"pronunciation"},{"start_time":"0.37","end_time":"0.699","alternatives":[{"confidence":"0.999","content":"learning"}],"type":"pronunciation"},{"start_time":"0.709","end_time":"0.819","alternatives":[{"confidence":"0.999","content":"is"}],"type":"pronunciation"},{"start_time":"0.829","end_time":"1.24","alternatives":[{"confidence":"0.999","content":"employed"}],"type":"pronunciation"},{"start_time":"1.25","end_time":"1.34","alternatives":[{"confidence":"0.999","content":"in"}],"type":"pronunciation"},{"start_time":"1.35","end_time":"1.36","alternatives":[{"confidence":"0.999","content":"a"}],"type":"pronunciation"},{"start_time":"1.37","end_time":"1.679","alternatives":[{"confidence":"0.999","content":"range"}],"type":"pronunciation"},{"start_time":"1.69","end_time":"1.75","alternatives":[{"confidence":"0.999","content":"of"}],"type":"pronunciation"},{"start_time":"1.759","end_time":"2.25","alternatives":[{"confidence":"0.999","content":"computing"}],"type":"pronunciation"},{"start_time":"2.259","end_time":"2.73","alternatives":[{"confidence":"0.998","content":"tasks"}],"type":"pronunciation"},{"start_time":"2.74","end_time":"2.94","alternatives":[{"confidence":"0.999","content":"where"}],"type":"pronunciation"},{"start_time":"2.95","end_time":"3.42","alternatives":[{"confidence":"0.999","content":"designing"}],"type":"pronunciation"},{"start_time":"3.43","end_time":"3.5","alternatives":[{"confidence":"0.999","content":"and"}],"type":"pronunciation"},{"start_time":"3.509","end_time":"3.91","alternatives":[{"confidence":"0.996","content":"programming"}],"type":"pronunciation"},{"start_time":"3.92","end_time":"4.389","alternatives":[{"confidence":"0.999","content":"explicit"}],"type":"pronunciation"},{"start_time":"4.4","end_time":"5.019","alternatives":[{"confidence":"0.999","content":"algorithms"}],"type":"pronunciation"},{"start_time":"5.03","end_time":"5.219","alternatives":[{"confidence":"0.999","content":"with"}],"type":"pronunciation"},{"start_time":"5.23","end_time":"5.409","alternatives":[{"confidence":"0.999","content":"good"}],"type":"pronunciation"},{"start_time":"5.42","end_time":"5.94","alternatives":[{"confidence":"0.999","content":"performance"}],"type":"pronunciation"},{"start_time":"5.949","end_time":"6.079","alternatives":[{"confidence":"0.999","content":"is"}],"type":"pronunciation"},{"start_time":"6.09","end_time":"6.539","alternatives":[{"confidence":"0.999","content":"difficult"}],"type":"pronunciation"},{"start_time":"6.55","end_time":"6.679","alternatives":[{"confidence":"0.999","content":"or"}],"type":"pronunciation"},{"start_time":"6.69","end_time":"7.48","alternatives":[{"confidence":"0.995","content":"infeasible"}],"type":"pronunciation"},{"alternatives":[{"confidence":"0.0","content":"."}],"type":"punctuation"},{"start_time":"7.55","end_time":"8.239","alternatives":[{"confidence":"0.999","content":"Example"}],"type":"pronunciation"},{"alternatives":[{"confidence":"0.0","content":","}],"type":"punctuation"},{"start_time":"8.25","end_time":"8.92","alternatives":[{"confidence":"0.999","content":"applications"}],"type":"pronunciation"},{"start_time":"8.93","end_time":"9.319","alternatives":[{"confidence":"0.999","content":"include"}],"type":"pronunciation"},{"start_time":"9.329","end_time":"9.659","alternatives":[{"confidence":"0.997","content":"email"}],"type":"pronunciation"},{"start_time":"9.67","end_time":"10.26","alternatives":[{"confidence":"0.999","content":"filtering"}],"type":"pronunciation"},{"start_time":"10.27","end_time":"10.89","alternatives":[{"confidence":"0.999","content":"detection"}],"type":"pronunciation"},{"start_time":"10.899","end_time":"10.979","alternatives":[{"confidence":"0.999","content":"of"}],"type":"pronunciation"},{"start_time":"10.989","end_time":"11.369","alternatives":[{"confidence":"0.999","content":"network"}],"type":"pronunciation"},{"start_time":"11.38","end_time":"11.859","alternatives":[{"confidence":"0.995","content":"intruders"}],"type":"pronunciation"},{"start_time":"11.869","end_time":"12.0","alternatives":[{"confidence":"0.999","content":"and"}],"type":"pronunciation"},{"start_time":"12.01","end_time":"12.359","alternatives":[{"confidence":"0.999","content":"computer"}],"type":"pronunciation"},{"start_time":"12.369","end_time":"12.909","alternatives":[{"confidence":"0.999","content":"vision"}],"type":"pronunciation"},{"alternatives":[{"confidence":"0.0","content":"."}],"type":"punctuation"},{"start_time":"13.06","end_time":"13.489","alternatives":[{"confidence":"0.999","content":"Machine"}],"type":"pronunciation"},{"start_time":"13.5","end_time":"13.739","alternatives":[{"confidence":"0.999","content":"learning"}],"type":"pronunciation"},{"start_time":"13.75","end_time":"13.85","alternatives":[{"confidence":"0.999","content":"is"}],"type":"pronunciation"},{"start_time":"13.859","end_time":"14.26","alternatives":[
